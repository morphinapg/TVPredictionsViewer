This app uses Firebase notifications, sent through Azure Messaging Services, so a device ID is collected by both of those services in order to push notifications to your device. I also use Visual Studio App Center analytics to gather fairly basic information on what kind of devices have installed this app, as well as which versions are installed, and logs if the app crashes. There is no other data collected, and none of this data could be used to identify anybody using the app. None of the details collected are shared with anybody.
